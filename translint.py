"""translint - catch broken translations before they ship.

Reads a base locale file plus one or more other locale files covering the
same keys and reports what's wrong: keys missing from a translation, keys
left over from a rename, placeholder tokens that don't match between the
base and the translation (the kind of bug that throws a runtime
KeyError/IndexError the first time that string actually renders), empty
values, and values that still look untranslated.

Supports JSON (nested or flat dot-namespaced keys), gettext .po, and Java
.properties files, auto-detected by extension. Standard library only. No
network, no dependencies, no eval/exec on file contents.

Usage:
  translint locales/                         # scan a directory, base=en
  translint locales/ --base fr                # use fr.json as the reference
  translint locales/en.json locales/de.json   # specific files
  translint locales/ --json                   # machine-readable
  translint locales/ --strict                 # also fail on extra/untranslated
  translint locales/ --allow-identical brand.name   # suppress one heuristic hit
  translint locales/ --fix                    # insert MISSING keys only, marked
  translint locales/ --fix --dry-run          # show what --fix would insert
  translint public/locales/ --recursive --locale-from dir   # en/common.json

Exit code is 0 when every locale is clean, 1 when translint found something
to fix, and 2 if a path couldn't be read or parsed at all - so a crash and
a lint finding never look the same to a script.

--fix never guesses at a translation. It only ever inserts a key that's
entirely missing from a locale file, tagged with an unmissable marker
([UNTRANSLATED], or .po's own fuzzy flag) that can't pass for a real
translation - see the "Fix mode" section below for the full scoping.

# Placeholder detection
#
# Five interpolation styles. A value is scanned with every style; whichever
# styles have at least one match are the ones used, so a project that only
# ever uses `{name}` doesn't get phantom checks run against `%s` syntax it
# never uses. If a value matches more than one style (rare, but plain-text
# next to a templated one happens), tokens from every style that matches are
# unioned - better a token set that's a little too broad than one that
# silently drops a real placeholder.
#
# Two pairs overlap syntactically and need one pattern's matches excluded
# from the other so a single token isn't counted twice:
#   - {{name}} (doublebrace) contains a {name}-shaped substring, which
#     "brace" would otherwise also match on its own.
#   - ${name} (dollar's brace form) ALSO contains that same {name}-shaped
#     substring, for the same reason.
#   - %1$s / %2$d (printf, numbered form) contains a $s / $d substring,
#     which "dollar" would otherwise also match as a bare $name token.
# Each exclusion works the same way: find the wider pattern's spans first,
# then drop any narrower match that falls entirely inside one of them. This
# is why doublebrace/dollar run before brace, and printf runs before dollar.

# marker produces for the other two formats, without inventing a second,
# redundant tag.
